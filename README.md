# SPOP
Software Engineering 1

This SPOP (Small Propriety Original Program) is a dog breed classifier using the K-Nearest-Neghbor Classifier. The program is given a dataset in csv format, containing low and high values for both height and weight, 3 dog sizes (small, medium, big) and 10 dog breeds (small dogs: french bulldog, chihuahua, pomeranian, poodle; medium-dogs: siberian husky, dalmatian, boxer and big dogs: great dane, saint bernard, mastiff)

data on dog breeds' weight and height collected from American Kennel Club, link: https://www.petplace.com/article/dogs/pet-care/american-kennel-club-akc-breeds-by-size/ 


SPOP is written in Python. 

The open-source distribution Anaconda will simplify the package management and deployment of our machine learning applications and data processing. The Jupyter Notebook, delivered by Anaconda, will be the application of choice to create, edit and display the output of the Python script.

To significantly reduce the complexity of the program, Scikit-learn library will be deployed to provide the tools for the machine learning and classification modeling.
