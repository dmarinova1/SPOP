This SPOP (Small Propriety Original Program) is a dog breed classifier using the K-Nearest-Neghbor Classifier. The program is given a dataset in csv format, containing obedience,low and high values for both height and weight, 3 dog sizes (small, medium, big) and dog breeds (small dogs: french bulldog, chihuahua, pomeranian, poodle; medium-dogs: siberian husky, dalmatian, boxer and big dogs: great dane, saint bernard, mastiff)
- Note: the obedience column containt percentage data signifying the ability of the dog to obey first command. The data was gathered from: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intelligence_of_Dogs#cite_ref-ReferenceA_18-0 

data on dog breeds' weight and height collected from American Kennel Club, link: https://www.petplace.com/article/dogs/pet-care/american-kennel-club-akc-breeds-by-size/ 


SPOP is written in Python. 

The open-source distribution Anaconda will simplify the package management and deployment of our machine learning applications and data processing. The Jupyter Notebook, delivered by Anaconda, will be the application of choice to create, edit and display the output of the Python script.

To significantly reduce the complexity of the program, Scikit-learn library will be deployed to provide the tools for the machine learning and classification modeling.
documentation scikit-learn helped build this SPOP program providing details on modules, methods, parameters specification:
